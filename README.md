# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis-MechaCarChallenge.Rmd

The MechaCar is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing teamâ€™s progress. The upper management has called on the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

CHALLENGE

- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, and write a summary interpretation of the findings.

RESULTS

Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- Vehicle Length and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.

- The slope of the linear model can not be considered to be zero. Note the upward path of the line on the graph.

- This linear model prediction of mpg of MechaCar prototypes is effectively accurate at 71.5% per the R-squared value.
